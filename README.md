# News Site

Create a news site with a topic of your choice. Use flexbox and grid for the layout. Make the layout responsive.

## The problem
Mobile layout: header, main news section and 1 small news-box/row
Tablet layout: header, main news section and 2 small news-box/row
Desktop layout: header, main news section and 4 small news-box/row 

I started making a sketch of the news site in figma, were things should be positioned. Here I need more practice, the sketch was very basic and I feel having a clearer plan about the design could have saved some time.

I used a grid layout and flexbox for my header. Grid for animated box.
For the "main" news and small news-boxes I went with flexbox. Trough this project I have gained a basic understanding of grid, flexbox, boxmodel and responsive design. 

I struggled with the img and text in the boxes, how to make them responsive but still fit. I tried to have most of the values in percentage to have them adjust and fit next to each other all the time. Here I need to learn more about what is the best way to achieve this.
Also how to choose size on the objects in the grid.

I tried to add some animations, I copied the one for the pulse function for the button. I created the moving box, not very smooth. It was fun to try and I look forward to gain more knowledge.
